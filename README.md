‚òïCoffee Sales Analysis


üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes coffee sales data by combining multiple tables (Orders, Customers, and Products) into a unified dataset using Excel formulas (XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and IF).
The goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales distribution.

![Loyalty Card](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24acaa78-0f46-4981-b814-6831370fae7a)

Loyalty Card Impact on Sales:

> Customers without a loyalty card generated $24,216.41 in sales.

> Customers with a loyalty card generated $20,917.85 in sales.

> Total sales amounted to $45,134.26.

Insight: While loyal customers contribute significantly, non-loyal customers currently account for a slightly higher share of total sales. 
This suggests potential to further leverage loyalty programs to boost revenue.
