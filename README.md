‚òïCoffee Sales Analysis


üìå Project Overview

This project analyzes coffee sales data by combining multiple tables (Orders, Customers, and Products) into a unified dataset using Excel formulas (XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and IF).
The goal was to create an interactive dashboard that provides insights into customer behavior, product performance, and sales distribution.

|              | Country         | Profit         |
|              | Postcode        |                |
|              | Loyalty Card    |                |

![Loyalty Card](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24acaa78-0f46-4981-b814-6831370fae7a)

**Loyalty Card Impact on Sales:**

> Customers without a loyalty card generated $24,216.41 in sales.

> Customers with a loyalty card generated $20,917.85 in sales.

> Total sales amounted to $45,134.26.

Insight: While loyal customers contribute significantly, non-loyal customers currently account for a slightly higher share of total sales. 
This suggests potential to further leverage loyalty programs to boost revenue.

* Highlighted country-wise sales contribution
* Recognized loyal customers and their impact on revenue
* Built a scalable template for future sales analysis

**Conclusion & Recommendations:**

**Current Observation:**

Total sales: $45,134.26
* Non-loyalty customers contribute slightly more ($24,216.41) than loyalty customers ($20,917.85).
* Loyal customers are already a significant source of revenue but not the majority.

**Insights:**

* There is room to improve sales among loyalty card holders. Encouraging more customers to join the loyalty program can help increase repeat purchases.
* Non-loyalty customers are currently driving higher sales. Strategies to convert them into loyal customers could further increase overall revenue.
* Analyzing top-performing coffee types and targeting promotions to countries or segments with lower sales could boost overall performance.

**Recommendations for Sales Improvement:**

* Expand loyalty program benefits to attract more customers.
* Promotional campaigns targeted at non-loyalty customers to encourage repeat purchases.
* Upselling or cross-selling popular coffee types based on sales trends.
* Country-wise marketing strategies to increase sales in underperforming regions.

**Overall: The sales performance is healthy, but focusing on loyalty growth, targeted promotions, and customer conversion strategies can further improve revenue.
